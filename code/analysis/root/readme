Step1.
-----------------------
Convert FinalEvents.dat file to ROOT TTree

>root  # run root
>>.X convert-events-to-simpleTTree.cpp  # convert your events
					# output "n= ...  currentEventNumber=" is possible (for numEnsembles * target_A > 5000)
					# the numbers in  currentEventNumber (5000 ,10000, 15000) may be repeated, this is normal

This will produce GiBUUEvents.root file.  For further analyses you can reuse this file.



Note. The default parameter kMaxNumberParticles=115 in convert-events-to-simpleTTree.cpp presuppose that there are no more than 115 outgoing particles in one event.
Change this if necessary (for example, if your nucleus is Pb282 you may NEED to increase it, if your nucleus is C12 you may want to decrease it)




Step2.
---------------------------------------
Run one of the existing analyses

>root 		  # run root
>>.L Analyze.C+g  # compile the script ; it MUST compile without errors
>>Analyze a	  # create object "a" of the class "Analyze"


Now you can run available analyses in any order
>>a.Loop()
>>a.LoopEnergyReconstruction("ArgoNeuT  #bar{#nu}-mode  #bar{#nu}_{#mu}-flux  CC")
>>a.LoopPionsInCLAS()
>>a.LoopMuonKinematics("ArgoNeuT  #bar{#nu}-mode  #bar{#nu}_{#mu}-flux  CC")  #the string gives the legend at top right of all of your plots and shows you reaction
									      # as you see from the example, notations are nearly the same as LaTeX (with # instead of \)
>>a.LoopNumberOutgoing("ArgoNeuT  #bar{#nu}-mode  #bar{#nu}_{#mu}-flux  CC")  # if you call with empty string LoopNumberOutgoing() the default string will be "#nu A"


Note-1. Output histograms are saved in files NumberOutgoing.root, MuonKinematics.root, EnergyReconstruction.root

Note-2. Some plots require external data files (ArgoNeuT*.exp, stored at /home/local/olalakul/myroot/Events-to-TTree/events) to put ArgoNeuT data on GiBUU calculations.
In the LoopNumberOutgoing.C, for examples, the defaults of these files are sometimes for neutrinos sometimes for antineutrinos.
This may not correspond to the reactions you are investigating. In this case delete the canvases and the output eps files with the names including "ArgoNeut"


Step3.
----------------------------------------
Create your own analysis
